        <h1> Top 5 programming languages computer engineering</h1>

        <h2> C PROGRAMMING </h2>
        <p> 
            C is a general purpose, procedural computer programminglanguage <br> 
            C in some applications might be outdated but it by nomeans going to extinct any time soon. 
            It was a wide array of uses andreal-world application and wil be applied in the industries for years tocome.
        </p>
        
        <h3> C++ PROGRAMMING</h3>
        <p> 
            C++ is an object oriented programming language.<br>
            The scopefor C++ s similar to previously mentioned C.
            Its still popular andlearning .It will never be a bad idea. 
            Especially C++ because it iscomparatively an easier language to pick up and learn. 
            It is also usedfor games as well as alongside graphical designs and 3D models.
        </p>

        <h2> JAVA </h2>
        <p> 
            Java is a class-based, object oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.<br> 
            Java is general purpose language that is well for games and mobile apps development. 
            It is also useful in enterprises level application as well as web apps. 
            It provides structure and maintainability of code.
        </p>
        
        <h2> PYTHON </h2>
        <p> 
            Python is an object oriented, high level programming language that was released way back in 1991. <br> 
            Python is best way for anyone, even people with no prior experience with programming or coding languages to get started with machine learning. 
            Python has a bright future in the devlopment field of programming languages especially in field of data visualisation, data science,data analysis,etc.
        </p>
        
        <h3> Javascript </h3>
        <p> 
            Javascript often abbreviated as JS is a programming language that conforms to the ECMA script specification. <br> 
            Javascript is an extremely popular language. 
            It is so widely used that it might take quite some time for another programming language to reaplace it. 
            It is mainly used in web development and artificial intelligence.
